This project is a terminal based version the classic game Minesweeper. To play, import the file to a python terminal and run the command `minas(c, l, n, d, s)`, such that:
 - `c` is the last column, that ranges from A to Z,
 - `l` is the last line, that ranges from 1 to 99,
 - `n` is the number of mines (a positive integer),
 - `d` is the dimension of a pseudorandom generator, which is either 32 or 64,
 - `s` is a seed for the pseudorandom generator as well, that is an integer ranging from 1 to 2^d.

You are going to be asked for coordinates(A01 for example) and take an action, mark (M) or clean(L).

Note: This is an academic project. The idea of the project came from Albert Abad (Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico, Lisbon, Portugal)
